# This file is generated on 26-Oct-2022 at 15:51:14 and contains for each site:
# press = air total pressure (hPa); temp = air temperature (K); vap = water vapour density (g/m^3) and hl = height level of reference amsl (km).
# All parameters are computed by: ITU-R P.835-4 model on Mean annual period.
# Atmospheric results are sorted acording to the site identification number:
#    _ 1 = Houston (Lat = 2.9560e+01 deg, Lon = -9.5100e+01 deg, Alt = 5.0000e-03 km)
# Stored values are organised as follow:
# Site number, height level of reference amsl (km), press (hPa), temp (K), vap (g/m^3)
1, 5.0000e-03, 1.0125e+03, 2.8812e+02, 7.4813e+00
